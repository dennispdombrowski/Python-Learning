# Python-Learning
 Using Automate the Boring stuff with Python along with FreeCodeCamp. Programs from that book and other tutorials along with random programs I write. Used to document my learning progress. 
 Files are named based off of what learning objective I was learning. For example in the Functions folder, all programs in that folder were aimed to help me learning about functions.
